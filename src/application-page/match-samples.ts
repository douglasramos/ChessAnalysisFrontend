Because in the Danish Gambit, Black can hold onto his extra pawn by playing c6 securing a solid position, but now Black's position will fall apart due to this weakness. His d-pawn is backward and I have strong control of the d-file. I'm also ahead in development.",

          "Now that the position has simplified we can analyse the position. There are only two sets of minor pieces on the board but white's bishop can come into play actively unlike black's white bishop while white's knight is also actively placed. White also has a large centeral majority and although the king looks awkward in the center its is perfectly safe.   Because of his small centeral majority, black's chances are on the queenside with his 2-1 pawn majority on the left wing. However, it will only be towards the endgame when black can exploit this and he must be content with developing and defending himself for now.   White on the other hand is looking for the d5 advance to create a passed pawn and even if it is not queened it will draw blacks forces away from his king where upon white will lauch an attack.",

          '! A very flexible move. The reason behind this move is that when white plays g5 black might block the position with h5 and g6 when the hole on f6 will become a weakness. Re2 allows the queen to come to f3 so that if the h5 g6 maneuvre is played, the queen can exploit the hole on f6. Furthermore, the rook is better positioned here as it can come to the c-file or d-file if necessary where as on e4 it cannot come to c4. It sometimes seems unecessary to do this move and if black had certain threats/counterplay it probably would be a waste of a move. However black do anything productive so white can afford to take his time.',

          "! secures my opponents resignation, my queen and rook will either force checkmate in a few, or I can take his queen and ease to victory Q vs R. Either way white saves himself some time and resigns. In all a good match, both players showed some really good positional play, in the face of losing material we kept to our guns and showed material isn't everything. Any comments on the game are welcomed, and I understand Robin is doing his own annotation of the game, so look out for that.",

          "The bishop's game, my new beloved opening against open games for almost a year now. While there's not tons of theory to learn, it's perfectly solid and playable, though not seen in top level chess anymore. After the usual 2. Nf3, Black still can choose between a variety of openings (...Nc6, ...Nf6, ...d6) where White has to be prepared. The bishop's opening often transposes to King's Bishop's gambit (1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4), a very fun opening but one that is, directly played, too dangerous for me in tournament play. Also there is an affinity to the Vienna game (1. e4 e5 2. Nc3).",
